While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the `metro` bundler.  The error message was vague, something like `Invariant Violation: ...`  It occurred seemingly randomly during development, and restarting the Metro bundler sometimes resolved it, but it would reappear later.  I tried cleaning the cache and reinstalling dependencies, but the problem persisted. The specific error message changed slightly from time to time but always stemmed from a core Expo/React Native module.
