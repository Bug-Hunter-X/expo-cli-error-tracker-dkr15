# Intermittent Invariant Violation Errors in Expo CLI

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered during Expo development where intermittent `Invariant Violation` errors occur, seemingly related to the Metro bundler.  The errors are vague and difficult to track down, even after attempting standard troubleshooting steps like cleaning the cache and reinstalling dependencies.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the intermittent `Invariant Violation` errors during development.  The errors may not appear immediately.

## Solution

The solution involves identifying and addressing the root cause of the `Invariant Violation`. In this particular case, it was the use of an outdated package causing incompatibilities. Updating the package resolved the issue.

## Additional Notes

This issue highlights the challenges of debugging vague errors in complex JavaScript projects.  Careful attention to error messages and dependency management is crucial for avoiding such problems.
